# Asset Catalog Open Metadata Access Service (OMAS) client

The Asset Catalog OMAS clients provides language-specific client packages to make it easier
for applications to call the interface.

The clients are: 
* The [**AssetCatalog**](docs/user/asset-catalog-omas-client.md) provides an interface to search for assets by type and
get information about them including their details, context, universe, relationships, classifications.
* The **AssetCatalogEventClient** registers a listener object that will process each of the events published by
the Asset Catalog OMAS.
