# The Asset Catalog OMAS Model

The Asset Catalog OMAS API provides the shared Java classes between the
server and client. It contains the following packages:
* api - interface and listener for interacting with asynchronous events
* exception - specific OMAS exceptions 
* model - that describes the Java POJO's shared between modules. 
Also, here can be found the beans for the REST endpoints. 


Details about exceptions used in Asset Catalog can be found [here](../exception/README.md)
