# Egeria's OMAG Server Platform assembly files

There are three directories in Egeria's OMAG Server Platform distribution:

* The `platform` directory includes all the files needed to run the platform.
* The `etc` directory has additional files and utilities that can be helpful when running the platform.
* The `opt` directory has samples and other useful content that can be helpful when experimenting with Egeria.

To run the platform, change to the `platform` directory and follow the instructions in the `README.md`.
