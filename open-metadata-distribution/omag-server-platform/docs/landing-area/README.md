# Landing Area

The *landing-area* directory (or any of its subdirectories) are monitored by the *integration-daemon* server.
If you add files under this directory, they will be automatically classified using their file name and file extension,
and then catalogued into the *active-metadata-store* metadata repository as [assets](https://egeria-project.org/concepts/asset/).
